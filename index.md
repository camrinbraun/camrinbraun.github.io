I am fascinated by fish and the ocean, and a childhood obsession with fresh and saltwater fishing has manifested itself into a career. In 2010, I joined a team of experts who employ cutting-edge tagging technologies to understand the ecology of the world’s most important fishes. Since, I have been elected a National Geographic Explorer and been inducted into the Explorer’s Club. My expeditions have ranged from sailing the remote Pacific to understand coral reefs to tagging sharks in Sudan. In 2012, I moved to Saudi Arabia to pursue a master’s degree in marine science where I used animal tagging to study manta rays movements and behavior in the Red Sea. In 2018, I completed my Ph.D. in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography where I explored the relationship between the movements of pelagic fishes and their ocean environment in the North Atlantic. From 2018-2019, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle where I was combining remote sensing and high-resolution oceanographic models to investigate how oceanographic features, such as fronts and eddies, influence open ocean ecosystems. In Fall 2019, I started the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/marinepredators/" target="_blank">Marine Predators Group</a> as Assistant Professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at UW.
