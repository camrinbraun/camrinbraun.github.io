I am primarily interested in the interactions between pelagic (open ocean) fishes and the biology and physics of the ocean. My current research focuses on how oceanography influences behavior of highly migratory fish species, like sharks, tunas and billfish. In the (Sub)mesoscale Group, I am investigating how mesoscale oceanography (eddies, fronts and other forms of ocean motion, like the Gulf Stream) drives movements and behavior of sharks and how different taxa with varying life histories may interact with the marine environment in different ways. To study these interactions, I deploy electronic tags on these study species and couple these observations with satellite, in situ and modeled oceanographic data and simulations to determine how oceanography influences species' ecology and their interactions with fishing fleets. <a href="https://www.camrinbraun.github.io" target="_blank">Website</a>; <a href="https://www.camrinbraun.github.io/assets/pdf/Braun_CV_recent.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>

Camrin is fascinated by fish, and a childhood obsession with fresh and saltwater fishing has manifested itself into a career. In 2010, he joined a team of experts who employ cutting edge tagging technologies to understand the ecology of the world’s most important fishes. Since, he has been elected a National Geographic Explorer and been inducted into the Explorer’s Club. His expeditions have ranged from sailing the remote Pacific to understand coral reefs to tagging sharks in Sudan. In 2012, Camrin moved to Saudi Arabia to pursue a master’s degree in marine science where he used animal tagging to study manta rays in the Red Sea. In 2018, he completed his PhD in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography where he explored the relationship between the movements of pelagic fishes and their ocean environment in the North Atlantic. He is now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle where he is combining remote sensing and high-resolution oceanographic models to investigate how oceanographic features, such as fronts and eddies, influence open ocean ecosystems. He hopes his work will directly improve management of living marine resources and keep them in our ocean for future generations to enjoy.
