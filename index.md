Camrin is fascinated by fish, and a childhood obsession with fresh and saltwater fishing has manifested itself into a career. In 2010, he joined a team of experts who employ cutting edge tagging technologies to understand the ecology of the world’s most important fishes. Since, he has been elected a National Geographic Explorer and been inducted into the Explorer’s Club. His expeditions have ranged from sailing the remote Pacific to understand coral reefs to tagging sharks in Sudan. In 2012, Camrin moved to Saudi Arabia to pursue a master’s degree in marine science where he used animal tagging to study manta rays in the Red Sea. In 2018, he completed his PhD in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography where he explored the relationship between the movements of pelagic fishes and their ocean environment in the North Atlantic. He is now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle where he is combining remote sensing and high-resolution oceanographic models to investigate how oceanographic features, such as fronts and eddies, influence open ocean ecosystems. He hopes his work will directly improve management of living marine resources and keep them in our ocean for future generations to enjoy.
