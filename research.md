I am primarily interested in the interactions between pelagic (open ocean) fishes and the biology and physics of the ocean. My current research focuses on how these physical-biological interactions drive the structure and function of (mostly) pelagic ecosystems. For more info and most recent updates to my research, please visit our group <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/marinepredators/publications/" target="_blank">website</a>.
