I am primarily interested in the interactions between pelagic (open ocean) fishes and the biology and physics of the ocean. My current research focuses on how oceanography influences behavior of highly migratory fish species, like sharks, tunas and billfish. In the (Sub)mesoscale Group at the Applied Physics Laboratory at UW, I am investigating how mesoscale oceanography (eddies, fronts and other forms of ocean motion, like the Gulf Stream) drives movements and behavior of sharks and how different taxa with varying life histories may interact with the marine environment in different ways. To study these interactions, I deploy electronic tags on these study species and couple these observations with satellite, <i>in situ</i> and modeled oceanographic data and simulations to determine how oceanography influences species' ecology and their interactions with fishing fleets.

You can check out some of the sharks I'm tracking live on the <a href="https://www.ocearch.org/" target="_blank">OCEARCH Shark Tracker</a>. <a href="https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/?details=273/" target="_blank">YINZER</a> is a shortfin mako shark I recently tagged near Cape Cod. He has been busy swimming around the NW Atlantic and sending us excellent data on movements, behavior and habitat use of this important species.
