I am primarily interested in the interactions between pelagic (open ocean) fishes and the biology and physics of the ocean. My current research focuses on how oceanography influences behavior of highly migratory fish species, like sharks, tunas and billfish. In the (Sub)mesoscale Group, I am investigating how mesoscale oceanography (eddies, fronts and other forms of ocean motion, like the Gulf Stream) drives movements and behavior of sharks and how different taxa with varying life histories may interact with the marine environment in different ways. To study these interactions, I deploy electronic tags on these study species and couple these observations with satellite, in situ and modeled oceanographic data and simulations to determine how oceanography influences species' ecology and their interactions with fishing fleets.
